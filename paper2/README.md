# Paper 2: TKDE submission source

Remaining submission work is tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

The active manuscript is `main.tex`, now formatted with `IEEEtran`. It describes an executable Double-DQN co-optimization benchmark and separates three types of evidence:

1. actual graph-state transitions for sequential graph/rule control;
2. stored LLM candidate logs for deletion/augmentation contribution;
3. designed executable cases for rule-family coverage.

The old heuristic look-ahead simulator is not used as RL evidence. Unsupported exploratory cross-domain and rule-mining result tables have been removed from the active manuscript.

Build from this directory with:

```bash
tectonic -X compile main.tex --keep-logs
```

The latest compiled manuscript is `main.pdf`. Experiment commands and all output mappings are documented in `../docs/paper2_experiment_reproducibility.md`.

## Offline revision (2026-09-24)

The title and RL/dual-strategy main line are retained. New primary comparisons use
feasible-action baselines, a strong acquire-then-deficit heuristic, and forty
retrained ablation models. The generation analysis adds equal-call comparisons
and directly compiled typed-rule execution with source provenance.

The strong heuristic slightly outperforms Double DQN in the current controlled
environment. The hand-implemented family union and actual generated-rule
execution are separate results. Connecting validated generated rules to the RL
registry remains a required next experiment.

## Mathematical revision (2026-09-25)

The corrected environment and new training results are under
`../exps/math_revision_20260925/`. It counts newly introduced violations by
identity and records every reward component. A separate government-typed
archive bridge demonstrates rule activation and constraint-removal decisions.
See `../docs/math_revision_2026-09-25.md` for changes and remaining evidence.
