# Paper 2: TKDE submission source

Remaining submission work is tracked in [TODO.md](TODO.md).

The active manuscript is `main.tex`, now formatted with `IEEEtran`. It describes an executable Double-DQN co-optimization benchmark and separates three types of evidence:

1. actual graph-state transitions for sequential graph/rule control;
2. stored LLM candidate logs for deletion/augmentation contribution;
3. designed executable cases for rule-family coverage.

The old heuristic look-ahead simulator is not used as RL evidence. Unsupported exploratory cross-domain and rule-mining result tables have been removed from the active manuscript.

Build from this directory with:

```bash
tectonic -X compile main.tex --keep-logs
```

The latest compiled manuscript is `main.pdf`. Experiment commands and all output mappings are documented in `../docs/paper2_experiment_reproducibility.md`.
